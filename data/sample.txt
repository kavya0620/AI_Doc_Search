Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. 
It enables computers to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, and decision making.

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows systems to learn from data without explicit programming.

Deep Learning is a branch of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze complex patterns.

Natural Language Processing helps computers understand and generate human language.

This project is an AI based document search and knowledge retrieval system.

The system loads documents provided by the user and converts them into smaller text chunks.

Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using Google Gemini embedding model.

FAISS vector database is used to store and search these embeddings efficiently.

When the user asks a question, the retriever finds the most relevant chunks from vector store.

The Large Language Model generates final answer based on retrieved context.

Streamlit is used to create conversational user interface.

FastAPI is used to expose the system as an API service.

This system works completely offline without manual searching of documents.

The advantage of this project is fast information retrieval from large documents.

The limitation is that it answers only from provided documents, not from internet.

Embedding is a numerical representation of text in vector form.

Chunking improves retrieval accuracy and reduces token size.

Retriever uses similarity search to find matching information.

Prompt engineering guides the LLM to generate structured answers.

Memory module helps the chatbot remember previous conversation.

This project can be used in education, healthcare, and enterprise knowledge base.

Vector database is better than normal database for semantic search.

Gemini model is used as the Large Language Model in this project.

LangChain framework connects all components like LLM, retriever, and memory.

The final application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud.

Users can upload their own documents and chat with them.

This approach is called Retrieval Augmented Generation.
